This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

Two players, X and O, take turns to mark their symbols in a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all boxes are filled and no one wins, itâ€™s declared a draw. 

The game also has a reset button to start a new round. I have used basic programming concepts like DOM manipulation and event handling.
